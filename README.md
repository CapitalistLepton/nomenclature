# Nomenclature

Browser game based on names and forms. Currently there is only one form (clay), however in the future more will be added. The names are all 3 letter combinations using the nomenclator's alphabet. This alphabet has 12 letters. Each letter gives different attributes to the form based on the letter's position in the name.
